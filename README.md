Hi and welcome! As I am writing this very quickly because I've found out that @reenl was kinda needing this explanation (sorry for not having done this earlier bro!).

Some basic guidelines:

 1. Fork this repository and create your work based on the Development branch.
 2. Pull requests!
 3. Don't be a dick!

How to use
===

 1. Vagrant up.
 2. composer install.
 3. npm install.
 4. ./node_modules/.bin/bower install.
 5. ./node_modules/.bin/gulp (watch, if you want to automagically build your assets during development).
 6. Code conform PSR2 guidelines.
 7. Run/make unit tests.
 8. Run PHPMD (still needs implementation...)
